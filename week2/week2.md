Week2: Getting started with R
================

Overview
========

What is R?
----------

-   R is a programming environment
    -   uses a well-developed but simple programming language
    -   allows for rapid development of new tools according to user demand
    -   these tools are distributed as packages, which any user can download to customize the R environment

Why using R?
------------

-   Complete statistical environment and programming language
-   Efficient functions and data structures for data analysis
-   Powerful graphics
-   Access to fast growing number of analysis packages
-   Most widely used language in applied statistics
-   Is standard for data mining and statistical analysis
-   Technical advantages: free, open-source, available for all OSs

R installation
--------------

-   Base R and most R packages are available for download from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
    -   [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/J)
    -   base R comes with a number of basic data management, analysis, and graphical tools
    -   R's power and flexibility, however, lie in its array of packages (currently more 8,000!)

R Working Environments
----------------------

Working environments (IDEs) for R
---------------------------------

Some R working environments with support for syntax highlighting and utilities to send code to the R console:

-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/features): excellent choice for beginners ([Cheat Sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf))
-   Basic R code editors provided by Rguis
-   [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), [Rgedit](http://rgedit.sourceforge.net/), [RKWard](https://rkward.kde.org/), [Eclipse](http://www.walware.de/goto/statet), [Tinn-R](http://www.sciviews.org/Tinn-R/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [NppToR](http://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/)
-   [Vim-R-Tmux](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/programming-in-r/vim-r): R working environment based on vim and tmux
-   [Emacs](http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html) ([ESS add-on package](http://ess.r-project.org/))

### Example: RStudio

New integrated development environment (IDE) for [R](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/). Highly functional for both beginners and advanced.
