title: "Homework: Use R as GIS"
output: github_document

Based on the accident dataset ('accident.dbf') we used last week, please
write R scripts to finish the following two tasks:

1. Map the locations of accidents based on the lat/long and use the United
States state boundary as the background. Please note the `accident.dbf` can
be loaded by the following codes, and there are invalid values for lat/long
column that you probably need to clean up before use.  

```{r load, evaf=T, echo=T, results='hide'}
library(foreign)
accident=read.dbf('Data/accident.dbf')
```

2. In the folder 'Data/Texas' contains the boundary of Texas counties.
   Using the `accident.dbf' data, please count the number of accidents for
   each county and make a county map based on the value of count you
   calculated.
